## Vision

The Vela Foundation's ultimate goal is to conduct multi-year globe-spanning voyages with a substantial fleet of sailing vessels. These voyages will emerge from an organizational structure that integrates strategic leadership in program approval and coordination with vast participant leeway in program genesis and execution. By empowering participants to pursue programs of their own devising, this approach will yield high levels of commitment and satisfaction. Some participants may also choose to expand existing programs, or to conduct multiple programs in parallel. Thus, while some programs will be pursued by only a single boat, others will encompass the entire fleet or portions thereof. Put into practice at sufficient scale, this system will maximize the strengths of our participant-driven programming model and allow us to work across the broadest possible range of our mandate. 

Imagine a chaotically nimble self-correcting gestalt that naturally forms a coherent symphony of efficacy and delight. That's us.

## Values

Our value-set has been formulated specifically to define and animate a comprehensive, internally coherent institutional worldview. The completeness of this framework gives us the freedom to pursue programming across the widest possible range of disciplines.

### Kindness, Wisdom, and Grace

Our choice of these values is informed by ancient notions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_the_Good" target=_blank>Form of the Good</a> and more particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentals" target=_blank>Transcendentals</a>, as subsequently developed by Emerson, Wilber, and others. The philosophical notions of goodness, truth, and beauty form an extraordinary symbol set in the realm of letters, but can appear lofty and unapproachable when they turn up on an action plan or a program proposal essay prompt. We have therefore chosen to cast them in more tangible terms as kindness, wisdom, and grace. These in turn determine the qualities of the lived experience we aim to bring forth.

Transcendental | | Value | | Experience
--|--|--|--|--
Goodness | &rarr; | Kindness | &rarr; | Vulnerability
Truth | &rarr; | Wisdom | &rarr; | Equanimity
Beauty | &rarr; | Grace | &rarr; | Wonder

### Some Gonzo

We're nimble, lean, fluid, bold, and a little bit dangerous. Some of our programs may feature enthusiastic engagement with the general public, but we don't "serve communities." We welcome everyone, but will never collate demographic data on our participants or our audience. We orchestrate voyages that demand the utmost of our participants, and in return offer them a chance to step into profound integrity and inalienable joy.

We're not here to soothe the status quo. The style and content of our programs will disturb broken systems of thought and action, launch provocative questions at unexamined aspects of reality, and advance wild possibilities for our life on this planet and beyond.

## Legally
