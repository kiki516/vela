> Vela Foundation programs operate at the interface of
mapped and unmapped epistemological territory.

## Spark

We begin with questions:

* What kinds of meaningful or interesting activities can we pursue on sailing boats, and in the uniquely remote locations which they can reach?
* What kinds of activities might be particularly heightened by being pursued in this context?
* *What singular gifts can sailors offer to the world?*

## Overview & Examples

At its heart, Vela develops participant-driven programs. Foundation leadership maintains a strategic vision regarding the kinds of programs the organization will sponsor, but doesn't define them directly. Instead, participants propose programs with reference to our central [values](/about/#values). These values then guide leadership as we evaluate, approve, guide, and coordinate the organization's activities. Thus our programming remains flexible and open-ended while clustering into three primary areas of endeavor, which fall broadly along the lines of our values.

Given our adherence to a decentralized programming model, there's a certain inevitable obliqueness in any discussion of future programming. That being said, we can at least imagine some concrete possibilities.

Value | Example Programs
--|--
Kindness | <ul><li>Itinerant medical clinic & lab</li><li>Refugee transport</li><li>Marine medical training</li><li>Cargo transport (charitable/humanitarian goods)</li></ul>
Wisdom | <ul><li>Think tanks, seminars, conferences, roundtables, workshops</li><li>Scientific research expeditions</li><li>Coastal permaculture</li><li>Cargo transport (commodity/commercial goods)</li></ul>
Grace | <ul><li>Artistic residencies, tours, collaborations</li><li>Mindful adventure expeditions</li><li>Cultural exchange expeditions</li><li>Contemplative practice</li></ul>


## Why Sailing?

The ancient pursuits of seamanship and navigation are perhaps the most fundamental and most exquisite of human endeavors. These disciplines express and embody our humanity like nothing else.

The challenges we find at sea are complex, continually emergent, and potentially life-threatening. By pushing the limits of a group's capacity, engagement with this body of practical knowledge forges durable and efficient teams. It binds shipmates into cohesion, integrating individual and collective responsibility.

Sailing is also great fun. At its best, it encompasses not only focused social intimacy, but an experience of the natural world at a level of immediacy rarely encountered under other circumstances. A sailing voyage can and should include shared home-cooked meals, music, conversation, swimming, stargazing, silence, sunrises, sunsets, creatures wild and free; an experience of bountiful essentials and scant cruft. A happy ship is the happiest of all possible places.

Imagine a crew who relate to one another with kindness, who meet enormous challenges with skillful wisdom, who enjoy the ineffable grace of life with blissful enthusiasm. These people can fulfill great works.
